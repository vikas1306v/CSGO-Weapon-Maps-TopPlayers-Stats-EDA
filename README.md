- `README.md`: This file serves as the main documentation for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of various CSV files containing CS:GO game data. The dataset includes information on weapon usage, map statistics, and player performance. Each CSV file contains different columns representing different attributes of the game.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the game:

1. **Weapon Statistics Analysis**: Explore the usage of different weapons, headshot percentages, and other related statistics.
2. **Map Performance Analysis**: Analyze the performance of different maps based on win rates, player kills, and other metrics.
3. **Top Players Stats Analysis**: Investigate the performance of top players, including their kill-death ratios, headshot percentages, and other key metrics.

## How to Use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Colab.
3. Follow the instructions and code within each notebook to run the analysis.
