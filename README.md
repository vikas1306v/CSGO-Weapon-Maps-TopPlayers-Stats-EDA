## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) data, focusing on weapon statistics, maps, and top players' stats. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of the game, including weapon usage, map performance, and player statistics.

## Contents

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with the EDA process and analysis.
- `results/`: This directory contains any visualizations, summaries, or results generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file serves as the main documentation for the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of various CSV files containing CS:GO game data. The dataset includes information on weapon usage, map statistics, and player performance. Each CSV file contains different columns representing different attributes of the game.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the game:

1. **Weapon Statistics Analysis**: Explore the usage of different weapons, headshot percentages, and other related statistics.
2. **Map Performance Analysis**: Analyze the performance of different maps based on win rates, player kills, and other metrics.
3. **Top Players Stats Analysis**: Investigate the performance of top players, including their kill-death ratios, headshot percentages, and other key metrics.

## How to Use

To reproduce the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions and code within each notebook to run the analysis.
